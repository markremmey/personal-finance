# personal-finance
Application to categorize personal finance transactions and generate reports

# To do:
- Create prediction API
- Prediction API should label the remaining records automatically
- Randomize the transactions that are provided, with a bias toward more recent transactions
- At first just have the prediction API take in the JSON and return a prediction by calling the OpenAI endpoint
- Then, use few shot examples 
- Then fine-tune
